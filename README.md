# ember-service-worker-update-notify

Adds a `ember-service-worker-update-notify` service and `<ServiceWorkerUpdateNotify />` 
component which displays a reload link if the service-worker has found an update.

## Usage

### Using the component 

The component will show a message to the user when the availability of an update
has been detected. Overwrite the default message using the component in block form:

```handlebars
<ServiceWorkerUpdateNotify>
  <a class="service-worker-update-notify" href={{this.router.currentURL}}>
    A new version is available, click here to update.
  </a>
</ServiceWorkerUpdateNotify>
```

Additionally, the frequency of how often a check will be made for an update
can be configured via the `pollingInterval` argument.
The time is measured in milliseconds. The default is 1200000 (20 minutes).

```handlebars
<ServiceWorkerUpdateNotify @pollingInterval={{2000}}>
  <a class="service-worker-update-notify" href={{this.router.currentURL}}>
    A new version is available, click here to update.
  </a>
</ServiceWorkerUpdateNotify>
```

The poll interval can also be configured in your `config/environment.js` with:
```js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  let ENV = {
    'ember-service-worker-update-notify': {
      pollingInterval:1200000 // Default is 20min
    }
  };

 return ENV;
};
```

### Using the service

The service allows you to react to an app update in a more programmatic manner, e.g. 
you could force reload the app. The service emits an `update` event once an update
has been detected. Here is an example of an application route that reloads the app
automatically:

```js
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default class ApplicationRoute extends Route {
  @service
  serviceWorkerUpdateNotify;
  
  beforeModel() {
    this.serviceWorkerUpdateNotify.on('update', () => {
      window.location.reload();
    });
  }
}
```

## Testing in Your App

Testing this in your app should mainly be concerned with presence
and and what it looks like.

During testing, the polling will be disabled,
and the reveal of the "New version available" content
is controlled by a promise set on the `window`.
In your tests, two helpers will aid you in asserting
presence and appearance: `setupServiceWorkerUpdater`,
and `hasServiceWorkerUpdate`.

```js
// ...
import {
  setupServiceWorkerUpdater,
  hasServiceWorkerUpdate
} from 'ember-service-worker-update-notify/test-support/updater';

module('Application | Index', function(hooks) {
  setupApplicationTest(hooks);
  setupServiceWorkerUpdater(hooks);

  test('the update is shown', async function(assert) {
    // assert that the content is not shown

    await serviceWorkerUpdate();

    // assert that the content is shown

  });
});
```
